# dna: originally stood for 'definetly not apl' but now does not

a teeny tiny lisp. a version that mangles things (idk why i made it) is at esodna.py

features:
    - string literals
    - importing other files
    - i/o (print, input, read, write)
    - if/while
    - lambdas
    - argv

samples:
    - `brainfuck.dna` 
        unfinished brainfuck interpreter
    - `test.dna`
        shitty test suite
    - `genesis.dna`
        basic functions
    - `2.dna`
        two. or is it?
